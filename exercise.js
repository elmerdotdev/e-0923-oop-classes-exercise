// Instructions: 10 points
// 1. Create a superclass called Employee
// 2. Add a constructor that takes in a name, salary, and hireDate. Create setter and getter methods for each property
// 3. Add a method called introduction that returns name, salary, and hireDate in a sentence
// 4. Create an instance called employee1 with your name, salary, and hireDate
// 5. Call the introduction method and output on the console
// 6. Create a class called Manager that extends the Employee class
